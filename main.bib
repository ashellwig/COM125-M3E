	abstract = {Listening is a vital part of people's daily lives. Listening is the only way they can properly learn new information or understand how to do things. Listening is done in a variety of situations and for a variety of reasons, many of which do not involve an overlapping skill set. When one listens to music, one is not involved in the same sort of activity as when one listens to a friend vent alter a difficult day of work or when one listens to one's employer give instructions on a new procedure. Listening is a popular subject among scholars of interpersonal communication for a number of reasons. The fact that interpersonal scholars are often teachers and that listening is understood as an important part of the students' lives undoubtedly plays a role in the reason for the popularity of the subject matter.},
