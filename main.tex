    \textbf{Overview}\\%
    Some people believe that you either know how to listen, or you don’t.\\%

    However, like most skills, listening can be learned. In order to do so, you
      need to better understand what listening is and how it works. Sometimes we
      aren’t listening because we are busy talking and disclosing things about
      ourselves that should perhaps remain private.\\%

    Because listening is a multifaceted skill, there are many different kinds of
      listening and ways to listen. In this assignment, you will study the
      different types of listening and analyze what you observed in the Erin
      Brokovich movie clip titled, “The Bonus Check” which appears immediately
      below the topic titled, ``Skills of Effective Listening''. View the other
      videos as well.\\%

    You should spend approximately 6.5 hours on this assignment.%

  \section{What Is ``Listening'' and Why is it Important?}
    \subsection{The Types of Listening}
      \begin{description}
        \item[Discriminitive Listening]
          Discrimitive Listening ocurrs at the beginning receiving stages of
            hearing new auditory stimuli and is a more focus-intensive form
            of listening to our surroundings
            \parencite[pp. 333]{noauthor_communication_2013}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{example}: After hearing a noise down the street come
              out of some alley we will focus our listening on that alley to
              ensure that the sound was not a sign of a struggle occurring, or
              an unknown danger about to occur.
          \end{itemize}
        \item[Informational Listening]
          Informational listening is when the listener is taking in the
            information with the intentions of comprehension and retention
            \parencite[pp. 334]{noauthor_communication_2013}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{example}: Placeholder.
          \end{itemize}
        \item[Critical Listening]
          Critical listening involves the listener hearing the information being
            given to them with the goal of afterwards analysing and evaluating
            said information
            \parencite[pp. 334--335]{noauthor_communication_2013}. This
            typically involves the listener providing some sort of evaluation or
            judgement after the conversation (agreeing, disagreeing, etc).
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{example}: Placeholder.
          \end{itemize}
        \item[Empathetic Listening]
          Empathetic listening is, in my opinion, the most important form of
            listening available. It involves us attempting to put ourselves into
            or at least feel the same emotions or pain that others are feeling
            \parencite[pp. 335--336]{noauthor_communication_2013}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{example}: Placeholder.
          \end{itemize}
      \end{description}

    \subsection{Self Disclosure}
      Self Disclosure is when someone intentionally reveals their own private
        personal information.

    \subsection{Listening's Role in Understanding}
      Placeholder.

    \subsection{The Most Important Type of Listening}
      The most important type of listening would have to be
        \textit{empathetic listening}. I believe this is important because
        empathy is, personally, what I like to look for depending on the type
        of problem I am coming to someone with. Empathy allows us to feel like
        we are not alone in our pain or happiness, and sharing the same emotion
        during a conversation as the speaker shows a deeper form of
        understanding than simply regurgitating the information.

    \subsection{Analysis of Erin's Listening in the Exploration Scene}
      I personally do not think that Erin's listening was the only problem
        that caused the misunderstanding we had witnessed
